# min_rnn
minimal char rnn based on tensorflow

Inspired by "GitHub - karpathy/char-rnn". I learned from "vinhkhuc/min-char-rnn-tensorflow.py"

This can be viewed as the simplified version of vinhkhuc's code.

To run it, replace the path in the following statement:

data=open("/Users/liup/rnn.test").read()
#
